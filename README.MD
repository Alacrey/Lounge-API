# Lounge-API
Python Lounge API built on Azure Functions and Cosmos DB

## Setup

1. Clone the Repo
2. Open it in VS Code
3. VS Code will prompt you to create a Virtualenv, make sure to do that and point it to Python 3.8 (install it if you don't have it)
4. Follow the steps in this article: [Quickstart: Create a function in Azure with Python using Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-python)
  a. You can skip "Create your local project" though because instead you will just clone this repo and open it in VS Code.
5. As part of this process it should have created a Cosmos DB for you, if not ask me for help.
6. Follow the "Download the function app settings" steps from [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-add-output-binding-storage-queue-vs-code?pivots=programming-language-python#download-the-function-app-settings)

After this you should be able to run the app locally, but chances are there are steps I forgot to let me know where you get stuck
